# ML-task-ImagoAI
# This project is about predicting DON (Deoxynivalenol) concentration in corn samples using hyperspectral imaging data. We use machine learning to train a model that can take in spectral reflectance data and predict DON levels. 

## What's Inside?

1. Load and check the dataset – See what's inside.
2. Preprocess the data – Clean and normalize the data.
3. Visualize the data – Plot some graphs to understand what's going on.
4. Reduce dimensions with PCA – Make the data easier to work with.
5. train a machine learning model – Use an MLP Regressor.
6. Evaluate the model – Check how good our model is.
7. Save the model – Store it for later use.

## Setup

First, you'll need Python 3.x and the libraries used in this project. You can install them easily using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib
